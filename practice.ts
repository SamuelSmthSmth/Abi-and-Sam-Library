//This is where I'm practicing my typescript

const const_1 = "This is a constant."
let const_2 = "\nThis is a variable."
//const_1 = "This is the second iteration of a constant"; This will definitely throw an error lol
const_2 = "\nThis is the second iteration of a variable."

console.log(const_1 + const_2)
